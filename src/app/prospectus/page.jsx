				Every election cycle, we get distracted by emotional topics— religion,
				caste, nationalism, outrage.
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				And in that noise, real issues get neglected— infrastructure,
				corruption, air quality, unemployment.
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				And yet, it would be convenient— too convenient— to place all the blame
				on those in power.
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				But let’s be honest for a second.
				<span className="paragraph-break" />A democracy does not merely reflect
				its leaders. It reflects its voters.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				And while public participation is essential, the character of the person
				we elect matters profoundly. <span className="paragraph-break" />
				An elected office is not a throne. It is a duty. It demands
				responsibility, integrity, and a willingness to be held accountable.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				Now consider this— <span className="paragraph-break" />
				If there exists an individual who has spent decades understanding
				responsibility— not as a slogan, but as a way of life.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				Someone who has proven himself outside politics, in the unforgiving
				realities of corporate work and entrepreneurship.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				Then such a person is far more likely to govern with seriousness than
				one whose sole qualification is winning the last election.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />I speak not merely as a citizen, but
				as a son. <span className="paragraph-break" />I was born in this
				one-room home in Nerul, Sector 8. Five people sharing limited space, but
				unlimited resolve. My father began here.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				As an employee, he worked long hours— not for recognition, but because
				responsibility does not punch a clock.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				As a father, he ensured we were cared for, even if it meant personal
				sacrifice. <span className="paragraph-break" />I often woke up after he
				had left for work and fell asleep before he returned.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				To him, hard work was not an act of heroism. It was simply expected.
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				Later, he built a business from the ground up. A solitary effort in a
				highly technical engineering field— competing with global corporations
				armed with far greater resources. <span className="paragraph-break" />
				What sustained him was not scale, but discipline. Meticulous planning.
				Analytical thinking. And an uncompromising commitment to excellence.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				In 2022, when I assumed responsibility for the business, he turned to
				public life. Not out of ambition, but out of obligation.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				Because the same principles that build credible institutions— process,
				accountability, foresight— are precisely what governance demands.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				To an engineer, development is never rhetoric. It is design. It is
				execution. It is maintenance. And his work speaks quietly, but clearly.
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				In the past three years— Smoke shops shut down in Sector 4, Nerul.
				Initiatives to improve safety and livability. Trees planted to combat
				rising air pollution. <span className="paragraph-break" />
				All accomplished without holding elected office. Simply because it was
				necessary. <span className="paragraph-break" />
				And if such commitment is possible without authority, one can only
				imagine what is possible with a mandate.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				The choice before us is not dramatic. It is deliberate.{" "}
				<span className="paragraph-break" />
				Vote for responsibility. <span className="paragraph-break" />
				Vote for accountability. <span className="paragraph-break" />
				Vote for Harish Ingavale.
